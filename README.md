# Software development plan
## Purpose and scope
### Purpose of the software
Nowadays, with the development of automation and mass production of house hold appliances, the price of these items are getting cheaper and cheaper. However, it can be a problem that we can accidentally purchase something that we already have.
The ApplianceApp is a terminal appliance built by Ruby that helps people organizing their household appliances. User can input their item and then access these items later. It helps to reduce the items people have to remember hence it can save time and improve their productivity.

### Problem and how the software solves it 
The application can solve the problem of tracking items in the house. Sometimes, moving or shopping can be hard if we can recall what we have at home. It can be very useful if there is an application that can list out the number of items we have. 
Getting a work-life balance can be very difficult these days as we have so many tasks to perform every day. The software can solve it by creating a list of items that can be easily stored and accessed later. By creating the CLI app, I have shortened the time of development as well as create quick and easy software to use.
### Target audience
The main target audience of this ApplianceApp are people who love shopping or people who have a lot of appliances. It can be used as a checklist for them before going out shopping or just simply when they want to locate a certain item in the house.
### How the target audience can use it
The app can be run very easy by some basic command lines. Users are only required to have just very little knowledge of the computer to operate it. The target audience can have a copy of the app on Github or a zip file. 
## Feature list
### CRUD
### Find item
### Nice output
